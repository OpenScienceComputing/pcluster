# pcluster config
The initial config was generated by Claude 3.5 using this prompt:
> Create an AWS Parallel Cluster configuration file that creates 6 slurm queues: both spot and on demand queues for: (1) a true HPC queue with the latest compute instances and EFA networking, (2) HTC low-cost instances with regular networking, (3) GPU queue for Machine Learning.  Also include a 10TB Lustre filesystem

I then installed pcluster thusly on Windows 11 WSL2:
```
conda create -n pcluster aws-parallelcluster
```
